## 📚 Reading Response  
**Title:** Hacktivist deletes white supremacist websites live on stage during hacker conference  
**Author:** TechCrunch Staff

**Citation style:** APA

### 1. Summary of the content  
This TechCrunch article documents a live hacktivist demonstration that took place during the Chaos Communication Congress in Hamburg, Germany. A pseudonymous hacktivist named Martha Root remotely deleted three white supremacist websites during an on-stage presentation, exposing serious security vulnerabilities in the platforms. The action was both technical and symbolic, intended to show how extremist infrastructure is often poorly maintained and insecure. Following the takedown, Root released scraped data revealing flaws such as embedded geolocation metadata in uploaded images. The event sparked debate around hacktivism, ethics, legality, and the role of technologists in confronting harmful online systems.

### 2. Quote from the content  
> “Root demonstrated how they were able to delete the sites live on stage, highlighting just how insecure the platforms were.”

### 3. Related comment on the content  
The article highlights the tension between legality and morality in technical practice. While unauthorized system access is illegal, the act reframes hacking as a form of protest and public accountability. It challenges the assumption that technologists should remain neutral, instead suggesting that technical expertise can be used deliberately to disrupt harmful digital infrastructures.

### 4. Related discussion question  
Should hacktivism be considered a legitimate form of political expression when it targets extremist or harmful platforms, or does it undermine ethical norms regardless of intent?

### 5. Related work of art, design, or technology  
A related example is **Anonymous’s Operation Payback**, a series of coordinated digital attacks targeting organizations perceived to enable censorship or extremism. Like Martha Root’s demonstration, these actions treat code and infrastructure as political space, blurring the boundaries between engineering, performance, and activism.
