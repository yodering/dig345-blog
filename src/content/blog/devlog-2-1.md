## Outcomes
# DevLog 2-1


## Create an Astro Starlight DevLog site

Follow the Astro Starlight tutorial to create a JAMstack website with Astro.js. You will use this site to post DevLog entries to record your work throughout the semester. :40 min

1. Fork an Astro Starlight site and update project structure.
2. Publish Astro Starlight using Github Actions ✏️ [LINK_TO_YOUR_REPO](https://github.com/yodering/dig345-devlog)
3. Add custom CSS to your theme
4. Import and use an Astro component
5. Continue customizing your site using the Starlight Docs and ✏️ explain what you did. - Copied the css from [HERE](https://omundy.github.io/dig345-radical-software/tutorials/astro-starlight/#create-an-astro-starlight-site)
6. Add content into: `devlog-1-3.mdx` (the DevLog from the previous week)
7. Add this file and `devlog-2-1.mdx` for today, and add content.
8. Watch 🎬 Heydon Pickering *Why is everything binary?*. Post a reading response in the 2-1 DevLog per information in the Assignments.
9. Write a reflection explaining what you learned in this DevLog. Link to sources.
10. Publish it and turn it in by posting the direct link to this DevLog on Moodle

## Context

## 📚 Reading Response  
**Title:** Why Is Everything Binary?  
**Creator:** Heydon Pickering  
**Source:** YouTube  
**Citation style:** APA

### 1. Summary of the content  
In *Why Is Everything Binary?*, Heydon Pickering explores why binary thinking—dividing things into two opposing categories—has become so dominant in both technology and culture. He explains how binary logic originates in computing systems, where information is reduced to on/off states, but argues that this technical constraint has unintentionally influenced how humans think about complex social, political, and personal issues. The video challenges the assumption that binary distinctions are natural or inevitable, emphasizing that most real-world phenomena exist on spectrums rather than in strict oppositions. Pickering encourages viewers to recognize nuance and ambiguity as essential aspects of understanding, especially when designing systems or engaging in discourse.

### 2. Quote from the content  
> “Binary thinking makes things easier to compute, but not necessarily easier to understand.”

### 3. Related comment on the content  
The video is particularly relevant to software and interface design, where binary choices often shape user behavior. While binary logic is essential for machines, applying it uncritically to human-centered systems can flatten complexity and exclude experiences that do not fit neatly into predefined categories. Pickering’s argument suggests that designers and technologists should be more intentional about when binaries are appropriate and when more flexible, gradient-based approaches are needed.

### 4. Related discussion question  
How does the use of binary structures in technology influence the way we understand identity, politics, or morality, and what alternatives could better reflect human complexity?

### 5. Related work of art, design, or technology  
A related technological example is **fuzzy logic**, which allows values to exist between true and false rather than forcing a binary decision. Unlike traditional binary logic, fuzzy logic models uncertainty and degrees of truth, making it useful in applications like climate control systems and AI decision-making. This approach reflects Pickering’s argument by demonstrating how non-binary frameworks can better align computational systems with real-world complexity.
