# DevLog 2-3: Create an Astro Blog Site

This DevLog documents my journey following Astro's Build a Blog tutorial to create a modular website using component-based design.

## Objective 1: Create a new Astro site and publish it on Netlify

The command to create a new Astro site:

```bash
npm create astro@latest
```

After running this command, I selected the blog template which set up the initial project structure with pages, components, and sample blog posts.

**Netlify Deployment URL:** ✏️ _[Add your Netlify URL here after deployment]_

---

## Objective 2: Create pages (.astro files) and blog posts (.md files)

### Pages Created
- [index.astro](src/pages/index.astro) - Homepage
- [about.astro](src/pages/about.astro) - About page
- [blog/index.astro](src/pages/blog/index.astro) - Blog listing page
- [blog/[...slug].astro](src/pages/blog/[...slug].astro) - Dynamic blog post pages

### Blog Posts with Frontmatter
All blog posts are located in `src/content/blog/` and use frontmatter for metadata:

```markdown
---
title: 'Post Title'
description: 'Post description'
pubDate: 'Jul 08 2022'
heroImage: '../../assets/blog-placeholder-1.jpg'
---
```

The frontmatter includes:
- `title`: The post title
- `description`: SEO description
- `pubDate`: Publication date
- `heroImage`: Featured image path

---

## Objective 3: Use Astro components to reuse common code

I've created reusable components in `src/components/`:

- [Header.astro](src/components/Header.astro) - Site header with navigation
- [Footer.astro](src/components/Footer.astro) - Site footer
- [HeaderLink.astro](src/components/HeaderLink.astro) - Navigation link component
- [FormattedDate.astro](src/components/FormattedDate.astro) - Date formatting component
- [BaseHead.astro](src/components/BaseHead.astro) - HTML head meta tags

These components are imported and used across multiple pages, demonstrating the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

---

## Objective 4: Create reusable layout components using `<slot />` and `Astro.props`

The [BlogPost.astro](src/layouts/BlogPost.astro) layout demonstrates both concepts:

### Using `<slot />`
The `<slot />` element allows child content to be injected into the layout:

```astro
<main>
  <article>
    <slot />
  </article>
</main>
```

### Using `Astro.props`
Props are passed to the layout and accessed via `Astro.props`:

```astro
---
const { title, description, pubDate, heroImage } = Astro.props;
---
```

This allows each blog post to customize the layout with its own metadata while maintaining a consistent structure.

## Objective 5: Challenges and Difficulties

---

## Objective 6: Display a dynamically generated list of posts

The [blog/index.astro](src/pages/blog/index.astro) page uses Astro's Content Collections API to fetch and display all blog posts:

```astro
---
import { getCollection } from 'astro:content';
const posts = (await getCollection('blog')).sort(
  (a, b) => b.data.pubDate.valueOf() - a.data.pubDate.valueOf()
);
---
```

This dynamically generates the blog listing page with all posts sorted by date.

---

## Objective 7: Dynamic page routing with `getStaticPaths()`

The [blog/[...slug].astro](src/pages/blog/[...slug].astro) file uses dynamic routing:

```astro
---
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const posts = await getCollection('blog');
  return posts.map((post) => ({
    params: { slug: post.slug },
    props: post,
  }));
}
---
```

This function:
1. Runs at build time
2. Fetches all blog posts
3. Generates a static route for each post
4. Passes post data as props to the page

---

## Objective 8: Install Astro Preact integration

Install the Preact integration:

```bash
npx astro add preact
```

This command automatically:
- Installs the necessary packages
- Updates `astro.config.mjs` with the integration
- Configures the project to use Preact components

### Client Directive for Hydration

Client directives control when and how components are hydrated:

- `client:load` - Hydrate immediately on page load
- `client:idle` - Hydrate when the browser is idle
- `client:visible` - Hydrate when the component is visible
- `client:media` - Hydrate based on media query
- `client:only` - Skip server-side rendering

Example usage:
```astro
<InteractiveComponent client:load />
```

### Interactive Preact Counter Demo

Here's a live example of a Preact component with client-side hydration:

<Counter client:load initialCount={5} title="DevLog Counter" />

This counter component demonstrates:
- **State management** using Preact's `useState` hook
- **Event handling** with onClick handlers
- **Client-side interactivity** via the `client:load` directive
- **Props passing** from the parent to the component

The component is defined in [Counter.tsx](src/components/Counter.tsx) and imported into this MDX file, showing how you can mix interactive components with static markdown content.

---

## Objective 9: Modify site design as if transitioning from WordPress

✏️ _Document your design modifications:_

[Describe how you modified the design and content. What WordPress-like features did you recreate? What design elements did you customize?]

### Design Changes Made:
- [ ] Updated color scheme
- [ ] Modified typography
- [ ] Customized header/navigation
- [ ] Updated footer content
- [ ] Added custom blog post styling
- [ ] Created custom homepage layout

---

## Conclusion

This project demonstrated the power of Astro's component-based architecture. Key takeaways:

1. **File-based routing** makes creating pages intuitive
2. **Component reusability** keeps code DRY and maintainable
3. **Content Collections** provide type-safe content management
4. **Islands Architecture** with client directives optimizes performance
5. **MDX support** allows mixing markdown with components
